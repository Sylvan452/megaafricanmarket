      <p>
        At Mega African Market, we strive to provide our customers with the best
        possible online shopping experience for African groceries. However, we
        understand that there may be instances where a return or exchange is
        necessary. To ensure a smooth and fair process, we have established the
        following return policy:
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-bold">1. Eligibility:</h2>
      <p>
        Returns or exchanges are accepted within 14 days from the date of
        delivery. - The item(s) must be unused, unopened, and in their original
        packaging. - Perishable or food items are not eligible for return due to
        safety and hygiene reasons unless there is a quality issue.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Return Process:</h2>
      <p>
        To initiate a return, customers must contact our customer support team
        within 14 days of receiving the order. - Customers can reach us through
        our website or by email, providing the order number, the reason for the
        return, and any relevant details. - Our customer support team will guide
        customers through the return process, providing instructions and a
        return authorization, if applicable.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-bold">3. Return Shipping:</h2>
      <p>
        Customers are responsible for the shipping costs associated with the
        return, except in cases of defective or damaged items. - We recommend
        using a reliable shipping method with tracking to ensure the safe return
        of the products. - If the return is due to a mistake on our part or if
        the item is defective or damaged, we will provide a prepaid return label
        or arrange for the pickup of the item(s).
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-bold">4. Refunds and Exchanges:</h2>
      <p>
        Once the returned item(s) are received and inspected, we will notify the
        customer of the status of their return. - Refunds will be issued to the
        original payment method used for the purchase, excluding any shipping
        charges. - If the return is approved, the refund will be processed
        promptly. The exact timeframe for the refund to reflect on the
        customer's account may vary depending on the payment method and
        financial institution.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-bold">5.Exceptions:</h2>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Certain products may have specific return guidelines or restrictions due
        to their nature or legal regulations (e.g., perishable items, personal
        care products, etc.). These exceptions will be clearly communicated on
        the product page or during the checkout process. Please note that Mega
        African Market reserves the right to refuse returns that do not comply
        with the outlined return policy or if the items have been used, damaged,
        or tampered with. We are committed to addressing any concerns or issues
        related to returns promptly and providing excellent customer service
        throughout the process. For any further inquiries or assistance, please
        don't hesitate to contact our customer support team.
